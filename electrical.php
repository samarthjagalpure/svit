                                        <div class="col-md-2"></div>
                                        <p class="col-md-8" align="justify">The Department of Electrical Engineering was established in 2011. The department has always exerted the best of its effort to meet the objectives of achieving technical 
                                            excellence in the areas of Electrical  Engineering such as Power Systems, Power Electronics & Drive Systems, Energy Systems, Electrical Measurements and Instrumentation, Industrial AC Machine , 
                                            Industrial Automation and Microcontroller. The department has well-equipped state-of-the-art laboratories to complement the theoretical course work. The faculty of the department have been involved 
                                            in several research projects in cutting-edge technologies and have publications in many international journals & conferences. The department also undertakes many consultancy projects from industry and other organizations.
                                            The testing and consulting service provided by the department faculty to the nearby college and schools of solapur district and industries.<br/> Organizations have placed the Industry-Institute 
                                            collaboration at a higher platform. The faculty members are actively engaged in the Consultancy and Product Development activities . Students from the department are recruited by multinational 
                                            Core-companies as well as IT companies. A large number of students have been obtaining admissions into various reputed institutions for higher studies. Presence of our alumni at various Industries 
                                            and MSBTE has helped our Students to plan their  graduate  studies.</p>
